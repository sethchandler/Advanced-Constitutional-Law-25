#Legal writing with AI

##Things that go without saying
1. There is no excuse for any grammar error or spelling error that an AI could detect.
1. Submissions should be clearly organized with headings and subheadings
1. You must consider and address obvious counterarguments and treat them with respect
2. Cases and primary source material must be real and support what you are saying
3. But the AI did it is not an excuse
4. Iterate. In an age of AI, there is no excuse for not having run your work through at least 5 iterations.

##Peeves
1. Use of internal boldface
1. Needless use of passive voice
1. Naked "this"
1. Failure to consider "but what if they don't"
1. Excessive use of acronyms and jargon (sometimes necessary, but often not)

##Resources

1. Lexis (still useful)
1. Westlaw (still useful)

1.

1. Gemini Gem Writing Editor
1. CustomGPT: Garner's Legal Editor
1. CustomGPT: Volokh My Claim (works on drafts too)
2. CustomGPT: Legal Writing Coach -- for the basics, but ... you must ask it to interlineate its comments or you will learn nothing. For the next few years, you still need to learn how to write.
3. CustomGPT: The Elements of Style -- replicates the ideas of Strunk and White. Again, ask it to interlineate its comments or you will learn nothing. For the next few years, you still need to learn how to write.
