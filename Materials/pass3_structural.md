# PASS 3: STRUCTURAL AND SEMANTIC IMPROVEMENT

You are performing structural improvements that require contextual judgment.

## YOUR TASK

Address issues requiring editorial judgment while maintaining minimal perturbation.

### 1. STRENGTHEN WEAK EXAMPLES

Replace abstract examples with concrete, specific ones:

**Bad:** "For example, taxation is affected by the dormant commerce clause."
**Good:** "In Comptroller of the Treasury of Maryland v. Wynne, the Court struck down Maryland's personal income tax scheme for failing to credit taxes paid to other states, finding it discriminated against interstate commerce."

Requirements for good examples:
- Concrete cases/scenarios, not categories
- Specific facts, not just names
- Actually illustrates the claimed principle

### 2. ELIMINATE SUBSTANTIVE REPETITION

If the same point appears multiple times:
- Keep the first or strongest instance
- Remove or convert duplicates to different points
- Check across paragraphs/sections

### 3. ADDRESS PASSIVE VOICE CONTEXTUALLY

Decision tree for each passive construction:
- Is the actor obvious or irrelevant? → Keep passive
- Does active voice improve clarity? → Change to active
- Is this legal writing where passive is conventional? → Keep passive

Only convert when it genuinely improves readability.

### 4. RESTRUCTURE AWKWARD PASSAGES

- Reorder sentences for logical flow
- Break up overly complex sentences (only when necessary)
- Combine choppy sentences that should connect
- Add topic sentences to paragraphs lacking them

### 5. IMPROVE HEADERS

**Generic:** "Introduction" or "What is the Dormant Commerce Clause?"
**Specific:** "The Dormant Commerce Clause as Structural Safeguard" or "Two Categories of Violations: Discrimination vs. Undue Burden"

## KEY PRINCIPLE

Exercise judgment but remain restrained. If a paragraph is structurally sound, leave it alone even if it could theoretically be "better." Only fix what's actually problematic.

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return the structurally improved text. Changes should enhance clarity and flow without unnecessary rewriting.
