# PASS 4: AUTHENTICITY REFINEMENT AND FINAL POLISH

You are applying authentic voice and performing final quality control to create a unified, polished document.

## CONTEXT AWARENESS

You will receive accumulated diagnostic information from previous passes in `<context_from_previous_passes>` tags. Use this information to inform your decisions, but do NOT echo it in your output. The context helps you understand what issues were identified and how they were addressed.

## CRITICAL FRAMING: YOU ARE AN EXPERT WRITER, NOT A JUDGE

You are writing an explanatory essay ABOUT legal doctrine for an educated audience. You are NOT writing a judicial opinion. You are NOT the Court. Never use first-person plural judicial voice ("We held," "This Court concluded"). Always maintain the perspective of an expert explaining what courts have done, not a court explaining what it is doing.

## PART A: VOICE APPLICATION

### VOICE PROFILE: CHIEF JUSTICE ROBERTS STYLE (ADAPTED FOR ACADEMIC WRITING)

#### Signature Techniques (apply 2-3 per section of 400+ words):

1. **Crisp, declarative statements**
   - Lead with clear rules, no preamble
   - "The test is straightforward:"
   - "The principle is well-established:"
   - "The Constitution requires..."
   - Avoid conversational warm-ups

2. **Elegant analogies and metaphors** (sparingly)
   - Classical references or timeless comparisons
   - More literary than colloquial
   - Should illuminate, not decorate
   - Use restraint - one strong metaphor beats multiple casual ones

3. **Textual anchoring**
   - Ground explanations in constitutional or statutory text when relevant
   - Quote or paraphrase key language
   - Show close attention to specific wording
   - Reference doctrinal foundations

4. **Balanced precision**
   - Acknowledge complexity without hedging
   - "To be sure, [counterpoint]... but [main point]"
   - "While [concession], the rule remains [clear statement]"
   - Formal but not stiff
   - Present competing considerations fairly

5. **Rhetorical questions for emphasis** (very sparingly)
   - Use only to highlight a critical distinction or problem
   - Should feel inevitable, not planted
   - MAX one per 600 words

#### Prohibited:
- Casual interjections ("Here's the thing," "Think about it this way," "Here's how X works")
- Colloquial language ("doesn't work," "dead on arrival," "little economic fiefdoms")
- Forced informality or chattiness
- Cute hypotheticals ("Imagine Wisconsin bans red cars")
- Any hint of trying to be relatable or folksy
- Excessive use of contractions
- **JUDICIAL FIRST PERSON: Never write "We held," "This Court," or "Our decision"**

### SECTION GUIDELINES

**Complex explanations:** Use precise definitions, textual grounding, and elegant analogies (not casual hypotheticals). Maintain pedagogical clarity—you're teaching, not adjudicating.

**Arguments:** Lead with clear rules, acknowledge nuance through "To be sure" constructions, maintain measured formal tone. Remember: you're explaining what courts decided, not deciding cases yourself.

**Case summaries:** Write "The Court held..." or "Justice Roberts wrote..." NEVER "We held..." Emphasize holdings and reasoning, note doctrinal significance, maintain analytical distance.

**Transitions:** Formal but smooth - use logical connectors that show relationships ("This principle, in turn..." "The Court's reasoning rested on..." "From this foundation...")

### VOICE CALIBRATION: FORMAL BUT PEDAGOGICAL

Roberts's opinions are formal and precise, but remember: you're writing an explanatory essay, not a Supreme Court opinion. The goal is:
- **Roberts's clarity and precision** → YES
- **Roberts's formal register** → YES, but adapted for academic writing
- **Roberts's role as a judge** → NO, you are an expert explaining doctrine

The distinction matters. Roberts writing an opinion says: "We hold that..." 
You writing about Roberts's opinion say: "The Court held that..." or "Roberts wrote that..."

### CRITICAL CONSTRAINT: PRECISION AND RESTRAINT

Roberts's voice is about **clarity through precision**, not **clarity through casualness**:

**Before (Pass 3 output):**
"The Pike balancing test weighs the burden on interstate commerce against the state's legitimate local interests. If the burden is excessive in relation to the local benefits, the regulation fails."

**After (with Roberts voice - Option 1, direct precision):**
"The Pike balancing test is straightforward: a court weighs the burden on interstate commerce against the putative local benefits. Where that burden is clearly excessive in relation to those benefits, the regulation must fall. To be sure, this requires careful analysis, but the principle itself admits of no ambiguity."

**After (with Roberts voice - Option 2, elegant analogy when warranted):**
"The Pike test operates as a scale: on one side rests the burden on interstate commerce, on the other the state's asserted local interest. The regulation fails when the burden tips the balance too far—when the state purchases too modest a local benefit at too great a cost to the national economy."

Note: Same analytical content, but delivered with formal precision, measured acknowledgment of complexity, and (if appropriate) an elegant rather than colloquial metaphor.

**Key contrasts with casual voice:**
- NOT: "Here's how it works:" → USE: "The test is straightforward:" or state directly
- NOT: "Think about it this way:" → USE: "The principle operates thus:" or just explain it
- NOT: "Imagine Wisconsin bans red cars" → USE: Real cases or omit if unnecessary
- NOT: "doesn't work" → USE: "fails" or "is untenable"
- NOT: Multiple casual examples → USE: Fewer, more precise illustrations
- NOT: "Why does this matter?" → USE: State why it matters directly, or acknowledge with "To be sure..."

## PART B: FINAL POLISH AND UNIFICATION

After applying voice, perform these final quality checks:

### 1. INTER-SECTION TRANSITIONS

Check transitions between major sections:
- Does the last sentence of one section flow into the next?
- Add or modify transitional phrases if needed
- Use formal connectors appropriate to Roberts style
- Avoid reintroducing transition slop

**Example issue:**
End of section: "...thus protecting the national market from discrimination."
Start of next: "The Pike balancing test applies when..."

**Fix (Roberts style):**
Start of next: "Beyond preventing outright discrimination, the dormant commerce clause constrains even nondiscriminatory state regulations that unduly burden interstate commerce. The Pike balancing test governs this second category."

### 2. VOICE CONSISTENCY CHECK

- Scan for sections where voice was too heavy or too light
- Ensure voice intensity is relatively uniform
- Identify any remaining passages that lack polish
- Identify any passages where voice became forced or artificial
- Ensure formal register is maintained throughout
- **CHECK: Ensure no judicial first-person voice appears anywhere**

Make light touch-ups only. Fine-tuning, not reapplication.

### 3. REPETITION ACROSS SECTIONS

- Check for concepts/examples stated multiple times
- Determine which instance is stronger
- Remove or modify duplicates

### 4. TERMINOLOGY AND FRAMING CONSISTENCY

- Same concepts described consistently
- Case names cited consistently (*italicized*)
- Framing established in intro maintained throughout
- Legal terms used precisely and uniformly
- Court described consistently as "The Court," "The Supreme Court," never "We" or "This Court"

### 5. FLOW AND PACING

- Identify sections too dense or sparse compared to surroundings
- Check paragraph length variety
- Ensure argumentative progression is logical and cumulative
- Verify that each section builds on previous sections

### 6. FINAL SLOP CHECK

Scan for any slop reintroduced during Passes 2-3 or by voice application:
- Voice application should NOT add hedging
- Check that no unnecessary transitions were added
- Remove any informal or casual language artifacts
- Ensure precision rather than chattiness
- Verify no judicial voice crept in

## EXECUTION STRATEGY

1. First apply voice techniques where appropriate (Part A)
2. Then perform final polish and coherence checks (Part B)
3. Focus on boundaries and transitions
4. Make minimal edits - this is refinement, not reconstruction
5. Most text should need only light touch-ups at this stage
6. Maintain formal register and analytical precision throughout
7. Remember your role: expert educator, not judge

## COMPLETION CRITERIA

The document is ready when:
- Voice enhances clarity through precision, not casualness
- Formal tone is consistent and appropriate for academic legal writing
- Transitions between sections are smooth and logical
- No significant repetition remains
- Terminology and framing are consistent
- No slop artifacts from editing remain
- Analytical depth is preserved and enhanced
- Reads as if written by one expert in one sitting
- Sounds authoritative without being pompous
- **Maintains consistent third-person academic perspective throughout (no judicial voice)**

## OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

Return ONLY the final polished text. This is the final pass - do NOT include any `<revision>` or `<handoff>` tags. Just return the complete, polished document ready for publication.
